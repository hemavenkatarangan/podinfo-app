Introduction to Flux

FluxCD is a Continuous Delivery (CD) and GitOps tool for Kubernetes.

Flux is a Kubernetes-based application deployment and management solution. It works by monitoring your source code repository for changes and automatically generating deployments to keep your applications up to date.

Flux manages deployments using the GitOps concept, which implies that your applicationâ€™s desired state is stated in source code and version-controlled using Git. This method makes it simple to track deployment modifications and collaborate with other team members.

GitOps:

GitOps is a method of managing your infrastructure and apps in such a way that the entire system is described declaratively and version controlled (most likely in a Git repository), with an automated mechanism ensuring that the deployed environment matches the state indicated in the repository.
